# Crop_Recommendation_System
ABSTRACT
The growing demand for food and the impact of climate change necessitate efficient farming practices. This study presents a machine learning-based application to assist farmers in selecting optimal crops for their farms. The system evaluates factors such as soil type, water availability, weather conditions, and crop suitability. Using Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision trees, and random forest techniques, the system predicts the best crops for specific locations. Testing with real-world data confirmed its effectiveness in improving decision-making for farmers. The system aims to increase crop yield while promoting resource conservation and environmental sustainability in agriculture.

INTRODUCTION
Modern agriculture faces challenges from climate change, limited resources, and population growth. Farmers struggle to select suitable crops due to varying environmental conditions. Traditional farming methods are no longer sufficient, leading to the adoption of technology-driven solutions. Machine learning-based recommendation systems have emerged as effective tools for addressing these challenges.
This research proposes a crop recommendation system using SVM, random forests, and decision trees. The system analyzes soil data, climate patterns, water usage, and historical farming records to provide accurate crop suggestions. By leveraging big data, the system outperforms traditional methods, enabling better resource management, higher yields, and reduced environmental impact.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Previous studies have explored machine learning in agriculture:
Sharma et al. (2020) developed a crop recommendation system using temperature, humidity, and soil moisture but ignored water availability and pest conditions.
Gupta & Bansal (2019) integrated soil quality and climate data with decision trees but faced challenges in adapting to changing conditions.
Patel et al. (2021) combined machine learning with financial analysis to improve farmer profitability.
Singh et al. (2022) used deep learning for real-time crop health monitoring but required high computational resources.
Raj (2023) implemented IoT-based soil monitoring but faced scalability issues.
This study addresses gaps by combining SVM with robust preprocessing for higher accuracy and accessibility.

CHALLENGES IN CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS**
Key challenges include:
Variable Agricultural Conditions: Soil, temperature, and rainfall vary significantly by region.
Data Complexity: Integrating diverse data sources (remote sensing, farm records) with noise and missing values.
Similar Crop Traits: Crops with overlapping requirements (e.g., wheat and barley) complicate classification.
Climate Variability: Unpredictable weather patterns disrupt traditional models.
Data Overlap: Soil and pest data must be carefully separated for accurate recommendations.
SVM-BASED CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
The proposed system uses SVM due to its effectiveness with high-dimensional agricultural data. Key steps:
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes features, and applies one-hot encoding.
Feature Selection: Prioritizes soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, and rainfall.
Model Training: Optimizes hyperparameters (C, gamma) via grid search and cross-validation.
Recommendation Engine: Suggests crops based on input conditions and provides yield insights.
METHODS
Data Collection: 15,000 records with soil pH, N/P/K levels, temperature, humidity, and crop types.
Preprocessing: SMOTE for class imbalance, Min-Max scaling, and outlier removal.
Models Tested:
Random Forest (RF): 92.5% accuracy.
Gradient Boosting (GBM): 94.2% accuracy.
Deep Neural Network (DNN): 95.8% accuracy (best performer).
Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
RESULTS & DISCUSSION
DNN achieved the highest accuracy (95.8%) but required significant computational power.
GBM balanced performance and efficiency (93.6% F1-score).
Data augmentation improved rare crop detection by 8.5%.
Critical features: Soil nitrogen, temperature, and rainfall.
LIMITATIONS
Data Dependency: Relies on region-specific datasets; struggles with incomplete data.
Computational Cost: DNNs demand high resources, limiting accessibility for small farmers.
Dynamic Conditions: Requires frequent retraining for climate adaptability.
User Interface: Farmers need simplified tools for practical adoption.
